# How to use this code

- To reproduce data preprocessing steps, refer content directory
- To evaluate KT methods in diverse setting, use kt_benchmark submodule
- To run AFM in the dataset, user pyAFM submodule


# Terms of the use.
Our data inherits the terms of use of CMU datashop (https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/Terms).

# Running environment.
We conducted this experiment on an M3 MacBook Pro with 36GB of shared memory. The experiments were conducted only once with the seed fixed on the code, and the seeds were not optimized for better results.

 abstract = {Knowledge tracing models have enabled a range of intelligent tutoring systems to provide feedback to students.
However, existing methods for knowledge tracing in learning sciences are predominantly reliant on statistical data and instructor-defined knowledge components, making it challenging to integrate AI-generated educational content with traditional established methods. We propose a method for automatically extracting knowledge components from educational content using instruction-tuned large multimodal models. We validate this approach by comprehensively evaluating it against knowledge tracing benchmarks in five domains. Our results indicate that the automatically extracted knowledge components can effectively replace human-tagged labels, offering a promising direction for enhancing intelligent tutoring systems in limited-data scenarios, achieving more explainable assessments in educational settings, and laying the groundwork for automated assessment.},
